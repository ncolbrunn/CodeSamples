Script2 is a simple program in C#. I made this on Unity in the summer for 2020 while I was working at Target. 
Our store was required to keep track of the flow of customers to make sure we were adhering to store capacity regulations. 
The system we were oringinally using had a lot of flaws that I knew I could fix so I made my own counter. 
It is very basic code but that is all that was needed. 
My version includes large buttons with haptic feedback for better user experience. 
(However the vibrations got annoying as were removed and replaced with colors)
I also included some interesting statistics like total amount of guests and daily high.

CelsiusFahrenheitConverter.java was an assignment we did in my Data Structures and Software Design Class. It is not super complicated but it was one of my favorite projects. It uses JFrame to display windows and buttons for ease of use.

Calc.c is the latest project we've done in my Programming Lang & Paradigms Class. It takes standard inputs in postfix notation to do calculations involving basic operations, modulus, sin, exponents, and power. It also handles negative numbers.
